        <h3>About me:</h3>
        <p>My name is Annie Nyamekye and I am from Ghana. I currently live in the UK and work as an Implementation Consultant. I aspire
          to become a Software developer in the next 2 to 3 years. I have a Masters in AI and Big Data which I hope to eventually do research in.
        </p>
        <h3>Why ALT School:</h3>
        <p>I have always been interested in Technology and how much impact it has in our lives. Having used a computer for the first 
          time when i was 12 years old, i was fascinated with how it worked. This led to my interest in how programs are written thus fueling
          my mission to learn software development. Alt School seemed like the best option for me because it enables one learn on their
          own pace.
        </p>
        <h3>My Goals and Aspirations:</h3>
        <p>It is my goal to go into software engineering and specialise as a Cloud engineer. In this course, i hope to be able to use the skills
          i learn from Alt School at work to increase productivity. Even though I have studied tech related courses, i have not been able to choose
          a specific pathway and this time it is my aim to understand Cloud Engineering immensely.
          
          <p>Overall, the path ahead is uncertain, and there's a sense of anticipation for the adventure that lies ahead. While I may not have all the answers, I'm excited to see what the world has in store for me. I firmly believe that this program is a stepping stone towards a future filled with possibilities, and I'm ready to embrace the wonderful adventure that awaits.</p>
